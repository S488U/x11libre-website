  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is Xlibre?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Xlibre is a freshly created fork of the Xorg X11
    server, initiated by Enrico Weigelt, aiming to provide a more actively
    maintained and modernized alternative to the aging X11 system.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why was it forked?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Xorg has been stifled by “toxic elements” and
    “BigTech moles” blocking significant contributions. A classic “embrace,
    extend, extinguish” pattern. Xlibre is presented as a pushback to
    revitalize the codebase.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Who’s behind Xlibre?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> The fork is led by Enrico Weigelt (<a href="https://github.com/metux">@metux</a>), previously a
    prolific contributor to Xorg.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What features or enhancements does Xlibre
    bring?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Code cleanups and modernization aimed at improved
    maintainability and performance. Support for Xnamespace (greater
    isolation) and updating nested Xnest to use libxcb.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What about Nvidia compatibility?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> We keep binary compatibility to proprietary Nvidia
    driver (Ver. 570 and newer).</p>
